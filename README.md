# Portfolio

This repository hosts the codebase of my portfolio site [tylerpaulson.com](http://tylerpaulson.com). It is a static PHP site written in PHP.

I've open sourced the code for others to see how I work and possiblly learn from it. The design of the site and all of the site's content remain copyright Tyler Paulson.

The codebase uses [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) for preprocessing and [Dandelion](https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion) for deployment (config file is ignored).

The typeface in use is [Lekton](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lekton).
