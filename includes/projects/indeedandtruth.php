		<em class="project--brief">Pro bono work</em>
		<span>I maintain responsibility for the majority of the ministry&#39;s creative and technical needs including the design of print materials, management of the website and online donations and development of tools to help with donor and volunteer management. The work of the ministry and the people involved are very close to my heart and I have traveled to rural South Sudan three times to work directly with the team on the ground.</span>
